# Toury App

**Toury** is a smart tourism platform that connects **tourists visiting Egypt** with professional **local tour guides** who speak their language — just like **Uber, but for tourism**.

The goal is to make it easy for visitors to find the right guide who understands their culture and can provide personalized tours across Egypt’s most beautiful destinations.

## Core Idea

- Tourists can **sign up and log in** to find guides nearby.
- Guides can **register** and list their languages and services.
- Tourists can **choose guides** who speak their native language.
- The guide helps the tourist explore attractions, museums, and landmarks.
- The platform is **simple, fast, multilingual, and modern**, with both **Light and Dark Modes**.
